# Core Navigation Flow Testing Guide

This guide outlines the process for testing all critical navigation flows in the SmartProBono application to ensure that users can move between different sections of the application smoothly.

## Prerequisites

1. The frontend application is running (`npm run start`)
2. The backend API is running
3. Test accounts with different roles are available (regular user, admin, etc.)

## Core Navigation Patterns to Test

### 1. Header Navigation Bar

**Test Case: Header Menu Links**
1. Log in to the application
2. Verify all main navigation links are visible in the header:
   - Dashboard
   - Forms
   - Documents
   - Services
   - Resources
   - Profile
3. Click each link and verify it navigates to the correct page
4. Check that the active link is visually highlighted

**Test Case: Logo Navigation**
1. From any page in the application, click on the app logo
2. Verify it navigates to the home/dashboard page

**Test Case: User Menu**
1. Click on the user avatar/name in the header
2. Verify the dropdown menu appears with options:
   - Profile
   - Settings (if applicable)
   - Logout
3. Click each option to verify they navigate to the correct pages
4. Test the logout functionality

### 2. Dashboard Navigation

**Test Case: Dashboard Widgets/Cards**
1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Verify all dashboard widgets are clickable and navigate to their respective sections:
   - Forms widget → Forms section
   - Documents widget → Documents section
   - Services widget → Services section
   - Recent activity widget → Relevant details page

**Test Case: Dashboard Quick Actions**
1. Identify any quick action buttons on the dashboard
2. Click each action button and verify it takes you to the correct form or action page

### 3. Form Workflows

**Test Case: Form List to Form Detail**
1. Navigate to Forms Dashboard
2. Click on a form category
3. Verify it shows the list of forms in that category
4. Click on a specific form
5. Verify it navigates to the form detail/filling page

**Test Case: Multi-step Form Navigation**
1. Start filling out a multi-step form
2. Test the "Next" and "Back" buttons between steps
3. Try navigating away and returning to verify form state is preserved
4. Complete the form and verify submission navigation

**Test Case: Form Submission Confirmation**
1. After submitting a form, verify you are redirected to a confirmation page
2. Test the "return to dashboard" or similar navigation options
3. Verify "create another" option if available

### 4. Document Management

**Test Case: Document List to Document Detail**
1. Navigate to Documents section
2. Click on a document category (if applicable)
3. Click on a specific document
4. Verify it opens the document viewer/detail page

**Test Case: Document Actions Navigation**
1. From a document detail page, test navigation for actions:
   - Edit document
   - Download document
   - Share document
   - Return to document list

### 5. Responsive Navigation

**Test Case: Mobile Menu**
1. Resize browser to mobile viewport (or use device emulation)
2. Verify the hamburger menu appears
3. Open the menu and check all navigation links are accessible
4. Test navigation through the mobile menu

**Test Case: Tablet Navigation**
1. Resize browser to tablet viewport
2. Verify navigation adapts appropriately
3. Test all main navigation patterns on tablet view

### 6. Error/Special State Navigation

**Test Case: 404 Page Navigation**
1. Manually enter an invalid URL
2. Verify the 404 page appears
3. Test navigation options on the 404 page to return to valid areas of the app

**Test Case: Unauthorized Access Navigation**
1. Try to access a restricted page (e.g., admin area with non-admin account)
2. Verify redirect to unauthorized page
3. Test navigation options from the unauthorized page

## Deep Linking Tests

**Test Case: Direct URL Access**
1. Test directly navigating to different URLs while logged in:
   - `/dashboard`
   - `/forms`
   - `/documents`
   - `/profile`
   - Any other significant pages
2. Verify each page loads correctly with all navigation elements

## Navigation Timing and Performance

**Test Case: Navigation Speed**
1. Time the navigation between key pages
2. Note any pages that take significantly longer to load
3. Verify loading states are shown during navigation

## Documentation

For each test case, document:
1. Whether the navigation worked as expected
2. Any errors or unexpected behavior
3. Browser and device information
4. Screenshots of problematic navigation issues

## Common Issues to Look For

- Missing navigation elements
- Links that don't respond to clicks
- Incorrect destinations when clicking links
- Missing breadcrumbs or back buttons
- Inconsistent navigation patterns between sections
- Navigation that breaks on mobile or tablet views
- Broken deep links
- Missing loading states during navigation
