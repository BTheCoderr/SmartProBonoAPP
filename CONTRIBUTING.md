npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage      # Run with coverage
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode
```

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/    # Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v # Verbose output
python -m pytest tests/ --cov # With coverage
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Test complete system
./test_complete_system.py

# Test specific features
./test_legal_chat.py
./test_email.py
