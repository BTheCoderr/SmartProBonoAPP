## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-pro-bono.git
cd smart-pro-bono
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
Create `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
FLASK_ENV=development
PORT=5001
```

### Restarting the Application

When you need to restart the application after closing it, follow these steps:

1. Open two terminal windows - one for the backend and one for the frontend

2. Start the Backend Server:
```bash
cd backend                          # Navigate to backend directory
source venv/bin/activate           # Activate virtual environment (On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate)
python app.py                      # Start the Flask server
```
The backend server should start on http://localhost:5001

3. Start the Frontend Development Server (in a new terminal):
```bash
cd frontend                        # Navigate to frontend directory
npm start                         # Start the React development server
```
The frontend should automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000

Common Issues and Solutions:
- If port 5001 is in use, you can change the port in the `.env` file
- If you see import errors, ensure you're in the virtual environment
- If the frontend doesn't connect to the backend, check that both servers are running
- If you see "module not found" errors, run `npm install` in the frontend directory or `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the backend directory

### Running Locally

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
