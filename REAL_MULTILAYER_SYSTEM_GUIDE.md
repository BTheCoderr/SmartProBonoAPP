# 🚀 SmartProBono REAL Multi-Layer Agent System

## ✅ **What You Now Have - TRUE Multi-Layer Intelligence!**

This is a **REAL multi-layered agent system** where agents can:
- **Call other agents** as sub-agents
- **Have complex workflows** with conditional routing
- **Use LangGraph-style state management** for true orchestration
- **Implement human-in-the-loop** for complex cases
- **Have layered decision making** with supervisor agents

## 🏗️ **Multi-Layer Architecture**

### **Layer 1: Supervisor Analysis**
- **Supervisor Agent** (GPT-4o)
- Analyzes user queries and determines complexity
- Routes to appropriate agents
- Decides workflow type (simple, complex, multi-agent, human-review)

### **Layer 2: Agent Orchestration**
- **Immigration Agent** (GPT-4o) with sub-agents:
  - Document Agent (for forms/documents)
  - Compliance Agent (for regulations)
- **Family Law Agent** (Claude-3-Sonnet) with sub-agents:
  - Expert Agent (for complex cases)
- **Business Law Agent** (GPT-4o) with sub-agents:
  - Document Agent (for entity documents)
  - Compliance Agent (for regulatory requirements)

### **Layer 3: Support Agents**
- **Document Agent** (GPT-4o) - Document generation and analysis
- **Compliance Agent** (Claude-3-Sonnet) - Regulatory compliance
- **Expert Agent** (GPT-4o) - Complex legal analysis

### **Layer 4: Synthesis**
- **Synthesis Agent** (GPT-4o)
- Combines multiple agent responses
- Identifies conflicts or gaps
- Creates coherent final response

### **Layer 5: Human-in-the-Loop**
- **Human-in-Loop Agent** (GPT-4o)
- Handles cases requiring human attorney review
- Prepares case summaries
- Provides interim guidance

## 🤖 **How Multi-Layer Works**

### **Example 1: Simple Query**
```
User: "hello"
↓
Layer 1: Supervisor → "Simple greeting, route to greeting"
↓
Layer 2: Greeting Agent → "Hello! How can I help?"
↓
Layer 4: Synthesis → Direct response
↓
Final: "Hello! How can I help with legal questions?"
```

### **Example 2: Complex Immigration Case**
```
User: "I need help with H1B visa application and compliance"
↓
Layer 1: Supervisor → "Complex immigration case, needs document + compliance"
↓
Layer 2: Immigration Agent → Calls Document Agent + Compliance Agent
  ├─ Document Agent → Generates H1B forms and requirements
  └─ Compliance Agent → Checks regulatory requirements
↓
Layer 4: Synthesis → Combines all responses
↓
Final: Comprehensive H1B guidance with forms and compliance
```

### **Example 3: Business Formation with Multi-Agent Workflow**
```
User: "How do I incorporate an LLC in California?"
↓
Layer 1: Supervisor → "Business formation, needs document + compliance"
↓
Layer 2: Business Agent → Orchestrates multi-agent workflow
  ├─ Document Agent → Generates LLC formation documents
  └─ Compliance Agent → Checks California LLC requirements
↓
Layer 4: Synthesis → Combines document generation + compliance
↓
Final: Complete LLC formation guide with documents and requirements
```

### **Example 4: Complex Case Requiring Human Review**
```
User: "I'm being sued for breach of contract and need defense strategy"
↓
Layer 1: Supervisor → "High complexity, needs expert + human review"
↓
Layer 2: Expert Agent → Provides legal analysis
↓
Layer 4: Synthesis → Identifies need for human attorney
↓
Layer 5: Human-in-Loop → Escalates to human attorney
↓
Final: "This case requires human attorney review. Here's interim guidance..."
```

## 🔧 **Agent Capabilities**

### **Immigration Agent with Sub-Agents:**
- **Main Agent**: Immigration law guidance
- **Sub-Agent 1**: Document Agent (forms, applications)
- **Sub-Agent 2**: Compliance Agent (regulations, requirements)
- **Workflow**: For complex cases, calls both sub-agents and synthesizes

### **Family Law Agent with Emotional Intelligence:**
- **Main Agent**: Compassionate family law guidance
- **Sub-Agent**: Expert Agent (for complex cases)
- **Workflow**: Acknowledges emotional aspects, calls expert for complex cases

### **Business Law Agent with Multi-Step Workflows:**
- **Main Agent**: Business formation guidance
- **Sub-Agent 1**: Document Agent (entity documents)
- **Sub-Agent 2**: Compliance Agent (regulatory requirements)
- **Workflow**: Multi-step process for business formation

## 🧪 **Test the Multi-Layer System**

### **Test Simple Workflow:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/api/legal/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "hello"}'
```

### **Test Complex Immigration (Multi-Agent):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/api/legal/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I need help with H1B visa application and compliance requirements"}'
```

### **Test Business Formation (Multi-Step):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/api/legal/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "How do I incorporate an LLC in California with proper compliance?"}'
```

### **Test Complex Case (Human Escalation):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/api/legal/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I need defense strategy for a complex breach of contract lawsuit"}'
```

## 🎯 **What Makes This Different**

### **vs. Single-Layer System:**
- ❌ **Before**: One agent per question type
- ✅ **Now**: Agents can call other agents, creating complex workflows

### **vs. Simple Routing:**
- ❌ **Before**: Basic if/else routing
- ✅ **Now**: Intelligent supervisor analysis with complexity scoring

### **vs. Static Responses:**
- ❌ **Before**: Fixed responses per agent
- ✅ **Now**: Dynamic workflows where agents collaborate

### **vs. No Human Integration:**
- ❌ **Before**: No escalation to human attorneys
- ✅ **Now**: Human-in-the-loop for complex cases

## 🚀 **Deploy to Production**

### **1. Update render.yaml:**
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: smartprobono-multilayer
    env: python
    pythonVersion: "3.11"
    plan: starter
    buildCommand: |
      pip install --upgrade pip
