## Overview

SmartProBono now features a real-time notification system that keeps you informed about important updates related to your legal matters. This guide explains how to use the notification features.

## Types of Notifications

SmartProBono sends you different types of notifications:

1. **Form Submissions**: Confirmation when your forms are successfully submitted.
